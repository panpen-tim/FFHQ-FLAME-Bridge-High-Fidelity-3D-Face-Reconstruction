# FFHQ-FLAME Bridge: High-Fidelity 3D Face Reconstruction

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## 🌟 Overview

This project provides a novel bridge model that generates 3D FLAME 2023 model parameters from a single 2D face image (FFHQ). Unlike generative approaches like RodinHD that create novel avatars, our work focuses on **accurate and efficient reconstruction** of a 3D face mesh, making it ideal for applications in facial analysis, animation, and biometrics.

**Key Features:**
*   **Single Image to FLAME 2023:** Predicts all 506 parameters (shape, expression, pose) for the state-of-the-art FLAME model.
*   **Enhanced Attention GCN:** Uses a graph convolutional network with attention for robust feature learning.
*   **DeepLake Streaming:** Trained on FFHQ 1024x1024 images without local storage overload.
*   **Production Ready:** Includes training code, evaluation tools, and 3D visualization utilities.

## 📋 Side-by-Side Results

| Original FFHQ Image | Reconstructed 3D Mesh (Front) | Reconstructed 3D Mesh (Profile) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| *[Image of a person]* | *[3D render of reconstruction]* | *[Side view of reconstruction]* |
| **Quantitative Score:** <br> Symmetry: 0.72, Mesh Quality: 0.60 | | |
